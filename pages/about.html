          <h2>About the project</h2>
          <p>The Facebook messages browser makes it easier to browse your Facebook threads, in particular by allowing you to upload and view multiple threads at a time, go to any date using the date picker, and by saving your location in the thread when you leave the page, so that you can resume reading the thread from the same location the next time you open the page. Finally, you will find some fun graphs about your threads in the analytics tab!</p>
          <p>I initially started this side project because I wanted to browse my own Facebook threads, but found it hard to do so on Facebook, particularly since it lacks the option to go to a particular date. As the project grew, I thought it could interest other people as well, which is why I decided to put it online.</p>
          <p>This is a pure JavaScript application: basically, it is a "pretty" interface for the archived threads, which I try to make visually close to the real Facebook messenger interface. </p>
