          <h2>About the project</h2>
          <p>I initially started this side project because I wanted to browse my own Facebook threads, but found it hard to do so on Facebook, particularly since it lacks an option to go to a particular date. As the project grew, I thought it could interest other people as well, which is why I decided to put it online.</p>
          <p>This is a pure JavaScript application: basically, it is a "pretty" interface for the archived threads, which I try to make visually close to the real Facebook messenger interface. </p>
          <p>The browser makes it easier to view your threads, in particular by allowing you to upload and view multiple threads at a time, go to any date using the date picker, and by saving your location in the thread when you leave the page, so that you can resume reading the thread from the same location the next time you open the page. Finally, you will find some fun graphs about your threads in the analytics tab!</p>
          <p>If you want to learn more about the project, you will find more information as well as the source code at the <a href="https://github.com/spqrxt/fbmessagesbrowser">Facebook Messages Browser Github repository</a></p>
